# Part 5: Attention Analysis & Interpretability Overview

## 🎯 Goal

Analyze attention patterns in the trained transformer model to discover interpretable behaviors where specific attention heads learn meaningful, consistent patterns.

## 🏗️ Model Structure Understanding

### Transformer Architecture

```
TransformerLM
├── Layer 0 (TransformerDecoderBlock)
│   └── CausalSelfAttention (with n_heads attention heads)
│       ├── Head 0 → Attention Matrix 0 (N×N)
│       ├── Head 1 → Attention Matrix 1 (N×N)
│       ├── Head 2 → Attention Matrix 2 (N×N)
│       └── ... (up to n_heads total)
├── Layer 1 (TransformerDecoderBlock)
│   └── CausalSelfAttention (with n_heads attention heads)
│       ├── Head 0 → Attention Matrix 0 (N×N)
│       ├── Head 1 → Attention Matrix 1 (N×N)
│       └── ...
└── ... (up to n_layers total)
```

### What We Get

For each input sequence, we extract:

- **n_layers × n_heads** attention matrices
- Each matrix is **N×N** where N = sequence length
- Each matrix shows how much each position attends to every other position

## 🔍 What We're Looking For

### Types of Interpretable Patterns

1. **Previous Token Attention**

   - Head consistently attends to the immediately preceding character
   - Pattern: High attention weight to position i-1

2. **Space Detection**

   - Head attends to space characters when processing consonants
   - Helps identify word boundaries

3. **Vowel-Consonant Patterns**

   - Vowels attending to consonants or vice versa
   - Different attention patterns for different character types

4. **Punctuation Patterns**

   - Characters attending to nearby punctuation marks
   - Helps with sentence structure understanding

5. **Repetition Detection**

   - Looking for repeated character patterns
   - High attention to similar characters in context

6. **Positional Patterns**
   - Attending to specific relative positions
   - Fixed offset attention (e.g., always look 2 positions back)

## 📊 Analysis Strategy

### Step 1: Data Collection

- Feed trained model with various input sequences
- Extract attention matrices for all layers and heads
- Store matrices along with input text and character information

### Step 2: Pattern Discovery

#### A. Visual Inspection

- Create heatmaps of attention matrices
- Look for clear, consistent patterns across different inputs
- Identify visually obvious attention behaviors

#### B. Statistical Analysis

- Calculate correlation between attention patterns and character types
- Measure how often a head attends to specific positions
- Analyze attention distribution across character categories

#### C. Automated Pattern Detection

Write functions to detect common patterns:

- **Previous token attention**: High attention to position i-1
- **Space attention**: High attention when current token is near spaces
- **Vowel attention**: Different patterns for vowels vs consonants
- **Positional attention**: Fixed offset attention patterns

### Step 3: Validation

- Test discovered patterns on new, unseen text
- Verify pattern holds consistently
- Measure strength/reliability of the pattern

## 🎯 Example Patterns We Might Find

### Example 1: Previous Token Specialist

```
Input: "HELLO"
Layer 0, Head 0 attention pattern:
H → [0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # H attends to itself
E → [0.0, 0.8, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]  # E attends to H (previous)
L → [0.0, 0.0, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0]  # L attends to E (previous)
L → [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.8, 0.0]  # L attends to L (previous)
O → [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.9]  # O attends to L (previous)
```

### Example 2: Space Detector

```
Input: "HELLO WORLD"
Layer 1, Head 2 attention pattern:
H → [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]  # H attends to space
E → [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]  # E attends to space
L → [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.8, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]  # L attends to space
...
```

## 🔧 Implementation Plan

### 1. Model Modifications

- Modify attention mechanism to return attention weights
- Update transformer to support attention extraction
- Maintain backward compatibility

### 2. Analysis Tools

- **Attention Matrix Extraction**: Get all attention weights for given input
- **Visualization Functions**: Create heatmaps and attention plots
- **Pattern Detection Algorithms**: Automated detection of common patterns
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation and pattern strength measurement

### 3. Analysis Workflow

- Load trained model
- Process multiple text samples
- Extract and analyze attention patterns
- Identify and validate interesting patterns
- Generate visualizations and reports

## 📈 Key Questions to Answer

1. **Which layer/head combinations show the most interpretable patterns?**
2. **What types of patterns are most common?**
3. **How consistent are these patterns across different inputs?**
4. **Do the patterns make linguistic sense?**
5. **How do patterns differ between English and Hebrew models?**

## 🛠️ Tools We'll Need

- **Visualization**: matplotlib/seaborn for heatmaps
- **Statistical Analysis**: numpy for correlation and pattern detection
- **Text Processing**: Character classification (vowels, consonants, spaces, punctuation)
- **Pattern Detection**: Custom algorithms to identify specific attention behaviors

## 🎯 Success Criteria

A successful analysis will:

- Identify at least one clear, interpretable attention pattern
- Demonstrate the pattern's consistency across multiple inputs
- Provide visual evidence (heatmaps) of the pattern
- Explain the linguistic significance of the discovered pattern
- Show how the pattern contributes to the model's text generation capability

## 🔍 The Big Picture

Each attention head can learn a **specialized role** in the language model. Some heads might become experts at:

- Finding word boundaries (spaces)
- Detecting character repetition
- Looking at previous characters
- Attending to specific character types
- Following grammatical patterns

By analyzing these patterns, we gain insight into how the transformer model processes and understands text at a fundamental level.
